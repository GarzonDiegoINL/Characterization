# Characterization

Here you can find useful code to help in the anaylisis of thin film solar cells and thin films poperties.

Right now we have several jupyter notebooks (python-based) programs for STAR logs, EDX data extraction, EQE, Solar simulator, and UV-Vis spectrophotometry analysis and one macro for ImageJ to do thickness analysis of SEM cross section images.
